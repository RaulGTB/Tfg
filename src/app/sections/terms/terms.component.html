      <p class="mb-4">
        While we strive to ensure continuous availability, the service may experience downtime due to maintenance,
        system updates, or unforeseen technical issues. As this is an academic prototype, the platform is provided “as
        is” with no warranties regarding uptime or error-free operation.

      </h4>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Our application may include a system of virtual coins, missions, and other gamified features. These elements are
        purely symbolic and have no monetary value. Users may not attempt to exploit, resell, or trade these assets for
        real-world compensation. Abusive or manipulative behavior may result in restriction or removal of account
        privileges.
      </p>

        All content presented on the platform—including the design, structure, and codebase—belongs to the development
        team and/or referenced third-party providers (e.g., PandaScore API). Unauthorized copying, distribution, or
        reverse engineering is strictly prohibited.
